**Intro**

This is a project about traveling across the US. I've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. 

My project can be found at: https://trunions.github.io/web_project_3/

**Tech Used**

 I used Figma and Visual Studio to complete this project. I was able to use techniques like psuedo rules and different display styles like flexbox and grid.

**Plans for Finalizing Project**

 I'll be changing anything I need to to pass my code review. stayed tuned! 

 8/13/2020: I improved the code by deleting unneeded code and cleaning up the HTML. I recoded the photo-grid and footer block to be more efficient. 

 8/14/2020: I cleaned up some code I forgot about yesterday and wrote a few more media queries to make my website more responsive.
